4. check the bubble remove kernel
5. reuse
6. fix the u/rho usage
7. 2d bubbles method change or check
8. delete the non-used memory/variable
9. change the boundary of 2D g (periodic?)

1. decide to rewrite some parts
    a. rewrite the non-kernel part
    b. rewrite the kernel part (surface part)
    c. rewrite the kernel part (bubble part)

Some issues:
1. I delete the remove parts since it seems to be never reference? (bubble remove and bubble remove last)
